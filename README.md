# QualtricsSiteInterceptForCanvas
Download the JavaScript file needed to use Qualtrics Site Intercept in Canvas LMS by Instructure.

Download the JavaScript file and replace the three instances of '*************' on line 82 with your Site Intercept ID. The Site Intercept ID is found at the bottom of the Deployment code for your Site Intercept in Qualtrics. It is the string of text that comes directly after ZN_. Also on line 82, replace '[brandID]' with your Qualtrics Brand Id. See the attached screenshot 'Intercept-DeploymentInfo.png' for reference. Then upload the custom JavaScript file to your Canvas LMS by Instructure theme. Consult your institution's Canvas Admin for guidance. See the attached screenshot 'Intercept-Conditional_Logic.png' for an example of employing condtional logic with your Intercept.
